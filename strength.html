        <h1> 8 Week Strength Building Workout for Beginners </h1>
        <img src="1.jpeg">

        <h2> Workout Description </h2>
        <p>This eight-week program is designed to help you get stronger throughout the entire body. Yes, the big three
            power lifts are involved, but this isn’t necessarily a powerlifting program. The goal will be to lift more
            weight with all the major body parts.

            You’re going to train five days a week, but none of these workouts will be that long. You should be in and
            out of the gym or weight room in less than an hour. We’re going to keep this to barbells and dumbbells as
            much as possible, but you can also expect some machine work. If you don’t have cables or machines, do the
            best you can with what you do have.</p>
        <p>
            Good news: we have a plan that will help you stretch sleeves, build mass, and bump up that number
            on the scale.If you can commit eight weeks to this as if your future depends on it, then you can
            kickstart your journey to getting swole.</p>
        <h2>The Workouts</h2>
        <p>

            The goal is to train five days in a row with two days off. If you need to take a day off in between because
            of your school or work schedule, that is ok. Just make sure you take two complete days off from weight
            training a week. Light to moderate cardio is ok, but you shouldn’t push it.

            The lifts you max out on are the opening lifts of each workout. Once you warm up, you will perform five
            working sets with the same weight. The weight you use will be a percentage of your max. That percentage will
            change each week. The chart below will show you what weights to use each week. This applies to all five
            opening lifts – squat, bench press, deadlift, standing barbell press, and bent-over barbell row. Rest for
            three minutes between each set of the opening lifts and two minutes between all other sets.
        </p>

        <h2> Recovery </h2>
        <p>Any and all forms of recovery could help you maximize your potential. Massages, foam rolling, stretching, and
            percussive gun treatments would all serve you well. The most important one of all is sleep. If you’re not
            sleeping enough, you aren’t going to see the best results.</p>


        <h2>What to Do After This Program</h2>
        <p>After you max out again on the eighth week, you can either give it a second run or move on to another program
            based on your new goals. That is up to you. If you take this for the full run, we would love to see how you
            do. Share your results in our comments section so we can encourage each oth</p>
