        <h1> Diet Plan for Weight Loss </h1>
        <img src="fat.jpg">

        <h2> Understand the Science Behind Weight Loss </h2>
        <p>Weight loss and gain revolve around caloric consumption and expenditure. Simply put, you lose weight when you
            consume fewer calories than you spend and gain weight when you consume more calories than you lose.</p>
        <p>
            To drop those extra kilos, all you need to do is eat within your calorie budget and burn the required number
            of calories. </p>
        <p>
            However, simply determining how many calories your body needs isn’t enough. After all, 2 samosas(550 kcal),
            3 slices cheese pizza(450 kcal) and 3 gulab jamuns(450 kcal) may be within your daily requirement of 1500
            calories, but these unhealthy food choices will eventually lead to other health problems like high
            cholesterol and blood sugar.
        </p>
        <p>
            To lose weight healthily, you also need to ensure your diet plan is balanced i.e. covers all food groups and
            provides all the nutrients you need for good health.
        </p>
        <h2> 1200 Calorie Weight Loss Sample Diet Plan </h2>
        <p>
            A lot can be spoken about what goes into an ideal diet chart. However, one’s nutritional requirement varies
            based on various factors. It could change depending on sex. Geography can play a role as well, with North
            Indian diets being largely different from South Indian ones. So, here meal preferences come into play since
            the consumption of food by a vegetarian or a vegan differs largely from that by a non-vegetarian.
            However, we have put together a diet plan ideal for weight loss with Indian food. This 7-day diet plan also
            known as a 1200-calorie diet plan is a sample, and should not be followed by any individual without
            consulting a nutritionist.
